iccMAX is a new standard specification for cross-media color management created by the International Color Consortium (ICC).
This specification includes a new gamut boundary description (GBD) tag which describes the color gamut of transformations in an iccMAX Profile.
The project aims to create an open source cross-platform application, only using open source tools, to visualize this GBD tag.
The report discusses issues to be solved and how they are solved, especially the parsing of the GBD tag and the visualization of it.
Some of the tools used include three.js, AngularJS and Chromatist JavaScript Library.
The result is a working application that accepts any iccMAX profile with a GBD tag defined and will display its gamut using a CIELAB space 3D model.
It shows that it is possible and feasable to create an open source cross-platform application for visualizing iccMAX Profile GBD tags.
